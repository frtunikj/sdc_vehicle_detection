Overview
---
This repo contains the code written to complete the fifth project "Vehicle Detection and Tracking" of the Udacity Self-Driving Car Nanodegree. This project consists a software pipeline to identify vehicles in a video from a front-facing camera on a car. 

About the project
---
An explanation of the files in this repository, the software processing piepline (i.e. HOG feature and color extraction, training liner SVM classifier, application of sliding-window technique and usage of the trained classifier to search for vehicles in images and videos) as well as suggestions for further improvements can be found [here](https://github.com/frtunikj/sdc_vehicle_detection/blob/master/writeup.md). 

Project environment installation
---
This lab requires:

* [CarND Term1 Starter Kit](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit)

The lab environment can be created with CarND Term1 Starter Kit. Click [here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit/blob/master/README.md) for the details.
